# 👋 Hi, I'm Falendra Bandhe

I’m a full-stack product engineer passionate about crafting scalable, user-centric systems. As a **Founding Engineer at KOSH**, I’ve built robust fintech platforms and real-time features used by 20,00,000+ users. I'm equally at home building pixel-perfect UIs as I am designing secure, multi-tenant backend architecture.

## 🔐 What You Won’t See Here

Most of my core contributions live in **private repos** on my organization’s GitHub. These include:

- A feature-rich real-time chat system (multimedia, URL previews, live location, mentions, pinning)
- A smart auto-recovery engine with IVR, WhatsApp, and SMS integrations
- Lead generation + referral systems integrated across platforms
- Live task management tools synced with Redmine
- Secure location tracking and productivity monitoring for sales teams

> These don’t show up in my GitHub contribution graph due to company privacy — happy to walk through them in more detail if you’re curious!
